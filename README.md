# Udacity-VR-Nanodegree-Project-1

## What did you like?

- I enjoyed getting the oppurtunity to develop an VR app and run it on my phone which i found was very exciting when it first worked. 

- Delving into the intricacies of the VR app and finding out what worked and what didn't. For example finding an aesthtic which was        appealing to be viewed in VR.
	 
- Experimenting with the code available to change the function of the code. 

## What was challenging?
	
- I found it difficult to change the function of one of the commands. After many failed attempts I was able to change the "Drop cubes from the sky" button to being able to drop either spheres or cubes depending on whether the shape in the room has been changed. I managed to add and change code correctly but I forgot that some settings in also needed to be changed to correspond with the changes in the code.
